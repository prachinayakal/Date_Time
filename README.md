# Date and Time Display Web Page

This simple web page displays the current date and time in a user-readable format. It continuously updates the displayed date and time using JavaScript's `setInterval` function.

## Features
- Real-time display of date and time.
- Hover effect on time display for an interactive UI.

## Files
- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: CSS file defining the styles for the web page elements.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file responsible for updating and displaying the date and time.

## Usage
Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the live display of date and time.

## How it works
The `script.js` file contains JavaScript functions that fetch the current date and time and continuously update the display area in the web page (`timeDisplay`) using `setInterval`.

Feel free to customize the styles in `styles.css` to match your preferences.
